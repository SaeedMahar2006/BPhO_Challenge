Plots the distance of the projectile from the launch point (0,0).

For high values of the launch angle, the graph can have a local minimum and maximum.
Try use the value pi/2 for the angle and zoom in on the cusp of the graph.
In this simulation the numerical instability around the singularity is really obvious.
